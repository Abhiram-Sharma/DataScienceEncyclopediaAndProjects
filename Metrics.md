### Key Metrics for Regression Models

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
   - Measures the average of the squares of the errors, where the error is the difference between the actual and predicted values.
   - Lower MSE indicates a better fit.

2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
   - The square root of the MSE, providing a measure of the standard deviation of the prediction errors.
   - Lower RMSE indicates a better fit.

3. **R-squared (RÂ²)**:
   - Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
   - Ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better fit.
