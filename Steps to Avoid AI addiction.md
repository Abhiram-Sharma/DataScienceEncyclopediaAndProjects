**1. Identify Your Usage Patterns:**

* Track how often you use AI for these tasks. Are there specific times of day or situations where you rely on it more?

**2. Re-Engage with Manual Skills:**

* Schedule time for activities that strengthen your core skills. Dedicate 15-30 minutes daily to reading physical books, writing by hand, or tackling logic puzzles.

**3. Leverage AI as a Tool, Not a Crutch:**

* Use AI to brainstorm ideas, then analyze and refine them yourself. Let it be a springboard for your own thinking.

**4. Focus on Complex Tasks:**

* Delegate repetitive tasks to AI, but reserve complex problem-solving for yourself. This will challenge your analytical thinking.

**5. Find Alternatives for Entertainment:**

* If you use AI for mindless scrolling, replace it with hobbies that don't involve screens, like board games, exercise, or social interaction.

**Remember:** AI is a powerful tool, but it shouldn't replace your inherent abilities. By being mindful and strategic, you can leverage its benefits while maintaining your own skillsets.

## Additional resources that might be helpful:

* Take online courses on critical thinking and problem-solving.
* Engage in discussions and debates to sharpen your analytical skills. 
* Consider joining a writing group or participating in creative writing exercises.

Don't hesitate to seek professional help if you feel overwhelmed by technology dependence.
